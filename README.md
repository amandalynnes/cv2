This is the first version of my online portfolio created entirely through HTML.
I plan to develop and build out multiple (probably three) versions of this site.

1. The first site built entirely with HTML.
2. The second version will be in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
3. The final version will be in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and possibly React.
    a) full stack version with front and back end, using forms, possible database for comments or messages.
