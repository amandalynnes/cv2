# cv2
This is the second version of my cv created with CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap.
I plan to develop and build out multiple (probably three) versions of this site.

1. The first site (titled cv in my guthub) was built entirely with HTML.
2. The second version will be in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
3. The final version will be in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and possibly React.
    a) full stack version with front and back end, using forms, possible database for comments or messages.
